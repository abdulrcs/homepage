      My parents bought me a basketball when i was a kid. so I played every sunday in the basketball court near my house,
      and I casually shooting basket to a ring that's too tall for my age, then basketball became my hobby since.<br>
      Fast forward to junior highschool, my school got a great basketball ring to play with, but the school itself
      doesn't have an extracurricular for basketball (what?) I ask my teachers about it and they said it's because
      the majority of students doesn't have an interest in basketball. I was upset, i need to <i>persuade</i> my friends
      to join basketball.<br> I invite some of my friends to basketball court in the evening when school's over and show
      what basketball is really about, eventually they got hooked into it, so i propose to my teacher about opening
      the extracurricular for basketball again and ask for a coach but then a plot twist happened,
      turns out my teacher was really good at <i>streetball</i> when he was in college, so we don't have
      to bother searching for a coach, and also we got to learn some cool <i>streetball</i> moves on the side.
      when we got good enough, we participate on some tournaments here and there, and what I love the most about basketball tournaments is the crowd, the way they chants the basketball team
      and the way everyone says "OOOOOH!" when someone make a cool moves is just priceless. <br>it never failed to
      gave me chills, by the time we won some of the tournaments,
      the new junior students started to have an interest in basketball, I was so happy to hear that!<br> The basketball extracurricular
      started to have more and more people and during my last year in junior high,<br /> My school has the best basketball
      team in my city after winning the big city tournament I- I- just can't explain how proud i am that day.

        I really liked watching movies & TV series to spend my free time,
        and i'm sure there's many people too aswell, especially now with the <i>netflix boom</i>.
        like there's SO MUCH good things to watch, there's the epic plot <i>Breaking Bad</i> about a chemistry
        teacher who sell drugs; there's <i>Mr. Robot</i> that tells a story about hacker and the unique premise
        of <i>the viewer is the main character imaginary friend</i>; there's <i>Black Mirror</i> which is the best sci-fi series in my opinion,
        every episode is a different story that tells about the <i>modern world</i>, what makes <i>Black Mirror</i> good is how close it gets
        the sci-fi to the actual world we live in today; there's <i>Silicon Valley</i> which is a comedy that tells a story about a group of friends making a startup in silicon valley;
        there's <i>Community</i>, a comedy about a study group in a community college, every episode never failed to make me laugh, the humour was perfect for me.; there's <i>Narcos</i>, a true story about Pablo Escobar, a colombian drug lord.
        and also there's the wide universe of marvel, that me and my friends always talk about in school, superhero movies is the thing that makes me want to learn how to edit video and do visual effects and make superhero-like effects on my friends that i talked about in <a href="interest.html"><b>Other Interest</b></a>.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The thing about watching movies & TV series is how it <i>raise conversation</i>. i have like hundreds of hour worth
        of conversation talking to my friends about how good a movie is, a theory about the movie, the similiarities of the superhero movies we watched compared to the comics, how we predict what the next movies going to be about. and how we booked a ticket to marvel movie the first day it came out to prevent spoilers. movies brought me and my friends closer.

        That's a video i uploaded on youtube when i <i>killed</i> the whole enemy team when everyone in my team is already dead on that round or also known as <i>clutch</i>, the game is called <i>Counter Strike Global Offensive</i> / CS:GO,
        I liked this game because of the competitive feeling to it, it kinda reminds me of basketball. everytime someone do a <i>clutch</i> or win an <i>impossible round</i> the whole team is cheering through the mic, just like in basketball when the crowds goes "OOOOOH!" after someone do a cool move.</p>

        <p>
          Before i'm into competitive games like CS:GO, i used to enjoy MMORPG games, mostly some underrated stuff, but my favorite MMORPG is called <i>Dream Of Mirror Online</i> I have a soft spot of nostalgia for this game, because when i was a kid, I woke up at 3AM to play this game and level up my character when the server is kinda empty so i have the whole <i>dungeon room</i> to myself because it gets crowded in the daytime, I feel some kind of euphoria just remembering about the times I played that games, that's how much i enjoyed it.
